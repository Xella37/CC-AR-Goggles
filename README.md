# CC-AR-Goggles

Uses [Pine3D](https://github.com/Xella37/Pine3D) and CC with Plethora to achieve augmented MC reality.

There is no documentation for this small library. Please look at the examples to figure it out :P

# Calibration

The demos use 120 degrees FoV by default. Please run one of the demos and then look a bit sideways from what is rendered, then adjust your own MC FoV to make sure it matches and everything is aligned.
